# Storyblok RichText Rendering Demo

This is a demonstration on how to represent RichText data from a Storyblok CMS instance in TypeScript & ReasonML.

Goal is to discuss major differences in pattern-matching behavior of [Discriminated Union Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#discriminated-unions), which in TS are represented as objects & interface type definitions, and as [variant types](https://reasonml.org/docs/manual/latest/variant) in ReasonML.

## Running the Code

```
npm install
npm run dev

# open localhost:3000
```
